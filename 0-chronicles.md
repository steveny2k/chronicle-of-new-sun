#Chronicles - aka simplified version of the main storyline

2020/1, an antimatter shows up from wormhole and hit our sun. Some portion of solar gas is lost in the impact. Now sun's nuclear reaction is not strong enough, and sun's death is in the near. The impact happened on the other side of the sun, so it was not observed on earth.

2020/2, an alien spaceship shows up from the wormhole. (It is later learned that aliens were doing experiment which resulted in the wormhole and antimatter.) The spaceship driver is solo. The spaceship crashes close to a farm house in the mid-west of USA. The wounded alien enters the house and implants a fetus inside a sleeping young woman in the house through some kind of robotic technique (since this novel is supposed to be family friendly).

He also broadcasts a message using shortwave radio, stating: a boy will be born carrying human's hope to defend the dying sun. The shortwave radio is received by small amount of people on earth, although it is broadcasted globally.

Soon, another spaceship arrives and takes the wounded alien away through a transporting light beam.

2020/3, scientists on earth discover the loss of mass of sun, and calculate that the sun will burn out in 10 years (before the sun eventually burns out, it will explode and the fire will engulf the earth), which would be 2030. So humanity needs to find a way to escape earth.

2020/4, United Nation passes several emergency decisions that a large organization shall be formed globally to organize the resources to build spaceships to transport human to the nearest stars which has earth-like planets (3 potential targets are decided, since never putting eggs into one basket), as well as cryogenic freezing (and especially thawing/reviving) technologies.

2021/6, a small country which has a large resource of an important metal for spaceship building has a citizen rebellion. The emerged new government refuses to continue participation in United Nation's plan, which is to sell their precious metal for cheap. Their people claim that the sun death theory is a hoax, and it is Imperialism imposed on them to squeeze their resources, and keep them poor.

2021/7, United Nation votes to organize an army formed by major western countries to attack that country and get the metal resources, 'for the survival of whole humanity'.

2021/8, war starts and continues. Due to the secret supplies from a major eastern country Sentre to that small country (to trade for the special metal supply in order to build their own spaceship), the war is not as easy as planned.

2021/10, in order to make the war and technology development fast and efficient, United Nation passes decisions to upgrade its power, and renames to be United States of Earth (USE). It also decides that any decision to be made in the future shall be beneficial to building spaceships and developing cryogenic technology. Majority of governments on earth have agreed to this decision, and to make it fair and efficient, a panel by leading scientists and engineers is to do fact-checking and input to a AI machine (developed by Goaga's AI group). And the AI machine is to calculate a score, indicating percentage of yes/no of a given proposal.

2021/11, meanwhile cyber-attacks initiated from an organization called Church of New Sun (CNS) show up online, citing they are the hope of reviving the sun, and calling people to join them. They steal money from banks through online attack, and claim they are doing so to build their own spaceship to fly close to the sun to cast some magic. It is found that members of CNS are hiding in the small country protected by Sentre.

The small country has already renamed it as People's Republic of New Sun (PRNS), and is organized in strict religious way decided by Church of New Sun (CNS), and has tried several spaceship launching toward the sun.

USE claims that PRNS is trying to develop the capability destroy the sun, which is similar to mutual destruction by nuclear warheads in the cold war era. So USE strengthen its efforts to invade PRNS.

2025/1, USE eventually decides to launch nuclear war against PRNS. Several spaceship launching sites are destroyed. However, 2 spaceships are already launched, and one of them has CNS leader inside. They are flying toward the sun. it would take them 7 months to arrive at sun.

USE, in fear of PRNS's attack of sun, put large amount of nuclear fuel in their built 3 spaceships, and launch them to pursue PRNS's spaceships. Such nuclear fuel were collected globally, almost depleted earth nuclear resources, and was planned for long distance traveling to near stars. However, to serve the urgent short-term task which is to destroy PRNS's spaceships before they destroy the sun, USE modified their spaceship in 1 week to make their spaceship fast enough to catch and use their onboard nuclear fuel to destroy PRNS's spaceships.

This can allow USE 5 years to develop other technologies not relying on nuclear power.

2025/6, USE's spaceships fly close to PRNS's spaceships and explode to destroy all of them before PRNS's spaceships can collide with sun. PRNS always claim that their planned collision with sun is to revive sun, and this method is taught by higher intelligent alien through Book of New Sun, and that alien has broadcast some indication at 2020. This claim, for sure, is not believed by USE. USE laughed at this claim initially when such claim showed up online, and is then frightened to see PRNS is formed based on an apparently April First joke.

Seeing religions are so powerful organize people and also some churches inside USE do not compromise with USE and claim that this is God's will to destroy humanity, human shall follow God's will and let new Noah (lots of people claim they are) to survive from ark, and rebuild earth after Big Flood (which is symbolic to sun's explosion and engulfing earth). USE has already started movement to remove religions from earth which has caused collisions.

2025/7, USE has occupied PRNS (and has sanctioned the major eastern country which supported PRNS) and take its metal resources for spaceship shell materials. Without much nuclear fuel left on earth, USE has lost its track. Internal conflicts start, and some militant group who are religion fundamentalists launches a coup, overthrowing USE which were controlled by AI and scientists/engineers.

the new militant government decided to follow what Bible said, to build Arks (which are spaceships to hide from the exploding sun) and survive the incoming Flood (sun explosion).

They decide that the most intelligent people on earth shall be preserved in Arks. they are the most smart scientists, engineers, and, richest people (who have earned a good amount money to prove they are smart, and also they supply money to build Arks). Since the left nuclear fuel on earth can only allow building small amount of Arks, this decision is reasonable, they believe, which is to 'save the seeds of humanity, even though having to sacrifice under-representative people'.

USE design attractive VR games to mentally control the majority people on earth, so that they will not rebel (at that time, majority people on earth do not know USE secret plan, and since they will soon die in 5 years, they can just enjoy themselves).

2027/6, USE has built and launched large spaceships to travel to the back of Jupiter. it will take 2 years for those Arks to fly to there. They could have done this earlier if there were not terrorisms attacks launched by the remaining CNS on earth, and small scale of rebellions inside USE (some people realize they are tricked by government's gaming scheme, and wake up from their indulgence in games, just like some people in Matrix realize this; at that time, most people are plugged into games through brain-machine interface and they stay in games all the time, just like in Matrix, however, there are people waking up from games...).

2027-2029, during the Arks traveling, sun has already begin the process to turn into a red giant. the radiation has damaged one Ark's power system. when it asks for help, no other Arks are willing, since they are also at the maximum budget of power allowance. On-board AI has calculated there is too much risk to save one Ark at the risk of killing other Arks. The cold universe and accurate calculation has told the answer. 

2030, Arks have arrived at the back of Jupiter. Each Ark has a separate government, and they have different style, democratic, dictatorship, etc. At that time, reviving from cryogenic freezing is not matured, so most people do not want to be cryogenic frozen before death. Those who do not have enough money to buy the food/water supply have to choose to be cryogenic frozen. Exceptions are those who are knowledgeable to a certain domain critical to the survival of humans in spaceship, specially agriculture in space.

2035-2040, there are some conflicts among the Arks and some Arks are destroyed.

2040/1, a hacker group named as New Hope, at the edge of a major conflict among the Arks, damaged all Arks' life support systems, and tricked people of all Arks to enter cryogenic system and be frozen. They claim their act is just and reasonable, to stop the conflicts and preserve humanity until higher intelligent alien can revive them from cryogenic system.

On the other side, PRNS.

2025/6, among the two spaceships PRNS launched to the sun, one has leader Johnson in it, which was hit by nuclear warhead and his remain scatters in the universe.

the other spaceship entered the wormhole the aliens created, and escaped the attack.

this spaceship entered aliens' territory. however, in alien's solar system, there is no solid planets. It is later found that that there was one which was aliens' earth, however, due to their experiments of anti-matter and wormhole, they have destroyed their own planet.

They also traveled to other solar systems to find solid planets.

however, they left some old space stations which can not fly far away, scattered around the gas planets in their solar system.

The surviving PRNS people then occupied those space stations. Those space stations have advanced technologies, like cloning, cryogenic freezing and especially reviving.

They and their clones form 4 factions, since they occupied 4 different space stations.

1. one faction collected portions of remain of leader Johnson (by flying back to human's solar system secretively through wormhole), and believe that after collecting all portions of Johnson, they can use such to collide with the original dying sun and revive it

2. one faction kidnapped Johnson's daughter, and believe his daughter has the same power as his father and can collide with the dying sun to revive it. Ethical dilemma: can they force his daughter to sacrifice her life for the greater good, saving human?

3. one faction forms alliance with the remaining of USE, trying to form peace. they are called traitors by the other 2 factions. And they try to save USE people and bring them to their world through wormhole. at 2050, They traveled to human's solar system through wormhole, and taking with them cryogenic reviving system created by alien. since they are deemed as traitors, their flying back to aliens' solar system through wormhole is a challenge.

4. one faction tries to seek guidance of the alien who came to earth and conceived leader Johnson. they fly away to follow alien's traits.
